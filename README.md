Richardson Extrapolation

In numerical analysis, Richardson extrapolation is a sequence acceleration method, used to improve the rate of convergence of a sequence. Practical applications of Richardson extrapolation include Romberg integration and the Bulirschâ€“Stoer algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations. Here in this repository you can find  application of Richardson extrapolation in Romberg integration and you can find method that shows how we can use Richardson extrapolation to improve the approximations found using the centred divided-difference formula.
